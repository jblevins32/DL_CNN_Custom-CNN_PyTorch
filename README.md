# My Notes
This assignment implements a convolutional neural network from scratch and using PyTorch. Data wrangling with focal loss is utilized for unbalanced training sets.

# File Structure
- `part1-convnet`: 
    - `modules`: Custom NN layers (`conv_classifier.py` is main function to run the network)
    - `optimizer`: Stochastic gradient descent optimizer
- `part2-pytorch`:
    - `models`: Pytorch created NN models (Resnet provided)
    - `losses`: Focal loss implementation
    - `solver.py`: Actual execution of pytorch models. See Juypter notebook for running solver.py!
